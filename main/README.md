# Main Program - GPT3 Voice Chat

To use this module you will need access to the open ai beta, more information is available on their [website](https://beta.openai.com/). Once you have the API key you only have to add it to an .env file and the program will load it automatically.

Also in order to run it you will need to have the Kaldi APIs running (or the deprecated websocket server with STT based on DeepSpeech) and the TTS api.
